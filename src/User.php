 * User is a user on the net and stored in MongoDb

 * Like Publishing entity, this is a vertex in the social digraph.
 * It's a rich document in MongoDb
 * It's designated as a "root-entity" in Yuurei persistence layer
 *
 * Why a User wraps an Author instead of inheriting from it ?
 * It is an optimization and future extension.
 *  * The first goal is to avoid cyclic graph for persistence
 *  * The second is you can have a identified Author coming from outside the app
 *    (coming from other networks for example)
